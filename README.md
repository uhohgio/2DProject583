# 2DProject583

<h2>Overview: </h2>
This 2D project entitled "My Skibidi Sigma" is a brainrot-inspired dating sim where the main character played by you tries to gain "Aura" by having conversations with girls in a college library setting.

<h2>Description: </h2>

**Premise:**

This game will be a 2D choices-matter, dating simulator where you play as a guy in the library who is trying to talk to all of the girls in the room successfully. You will be able to navigate the library on a pre-defined map, where you will be able to approach different girls across the map. When in a certain proximity, you will be prompted to click “E” to interact with each available girl. Upon interaction, you will be engaged in a dialogue with predefined, mouse-clickable choices to see how well you can keep the girl engaged without making her uncomfortable. Once you finish the conversation, you will be given a rating for your conversation as feedback to tell you how the conversation went, then you will return to the map. The more interactions you have, and the longer you can keep a conversation consensually, the more “aura” you will gain. Your aura is a numeric score of how well you are doing in the game. The library will be separated into sections by difficulty levels. The “nice” girls will sit at the front. These are lower stakes, low risk, and low reward. The “mean” girls will sit at the back; these are high risk, but you gain much more aura if you are successful. The game will end once you leave the library, regardless of how many interactions you’ve had, but once you leave, the girls will also leave so you will have to restart the game to achieve a different result or a different rating.

You start the game with 0 aura, which just means that you’re a “Nobody” This is a fresh slate and will leave you with the default conversation options. If your aura is between -1000 and 0, you are a “Gooner”. This is not a good reputation and will make girls weary of you but you can come back from this. If your aura is below -1001, then you are an “Incel” and you will no longer be able to talk to any of the girls. If your aura is between 1 and 2000, you are a “Rizzler”, which means you are doing alright talking to girls and you can still talk to girls without any stained reputation. If your aura is between 2001 and 3000, you are a “Sigma”, still good at talking to girls, but now you have a bit of a reputation. This is a bit of a dangerous place to be in because there are riskier dialogue options. If your aura is over 3000, then you are an “Alpha Chad”. Girls know you get around and they don’t care, everyone wants you. You have reached peak rizz. 

**Considerations:**

I will need assets for the setting and each character. I intend on having desks that the player has to navigate through, a solid color for the “floor”, and a simple asset for the door that is interactable to “leave”/ end the game. The main, playable, character will have a very basic look, top-down and so will the girls on the map. The girls will each have a more detailed asset for the dialogue screens and their backgrounds, which should cover all of the visuals. Every button/ interaction will have a sound, but no background or voices will be added for the first implementation. 

It might be difficult to add too many girls right away, but I think I’ll start with just two or three for the first release, one for each difficulty, and then if I have the time or resources, I can add more. Ideally, I would love to add a secret bonus girl for those who reach “Max Aura”, but I don’t think it is feasible within the allotted time.
